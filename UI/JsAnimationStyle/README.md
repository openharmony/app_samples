### Introduction<a name="section104mcpsimp"></a>

This sample shows how to use animation styles, gradient styles, transition styles, and custom font styles in JavaScript.

1. Animation styles: translate, rotate, scale, and combined

2. Gradient styles: linear-gradient and repeating-linear-gradient

3. Transition styles: shared-element, custom, and card

4. Custom font styles: implemented by referencing the .otf font file \(The same rule applies to the TTF font.\)

### Usage<a name="section111mcpsimp"></a>

In this sample, there are four buttons on the home screen of your app.

You can touch any of these buttons to access the corresponding style page and view how a style looks. For example, you can touch the Move button on the animation style page to see how a component moves with the defined settings.
