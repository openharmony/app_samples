# Example Shopping App<a name="EN-US_TOPIC_0000001159661605"></a>

-   This example JS-based shopping app uses a hybrid layout containing resources such as images, videos, and text. To optimize memory and performance, the lazy loading feature has been used for the sliding list. You can use the sample code as reference for your app development. This example applies to large systems \(reference memory ≥ 1 GB\).
    1.  The app consists of three pages: home page, details page, and comment page.
    2.  The home page comprises a nested layout of text and images. It uses the lazy loading feature to implement a sliding list.
    3.  The details page comprises  **swiper**  components with nested images and videos. You can click scrolling images on the home page to access the respective details page.
